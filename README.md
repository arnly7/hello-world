# hello-world
My training repository for GitHub
The GUI makes this so much easier to edit and understand actions taken and position of branches, etc.
I'm not totally new to git, but last time I was trying to use it without a GUI and without much assistance, and I don't think I understood what it was doing (the actual events taking place and the structure underneath) as I was making edits and submitting changes to a branch.  I kept getting changes submitted to new branches, instead of to the one I wanted - and I think I was having difficulty telling whether I was working in the same repository as the others (online) or in a clone.  the lack of GUI made it a lot harder to tell where I was actually working.
